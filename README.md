## Abstract

<p align="justify">

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been proven to help with removing organic and inorganic wastes with the use of hydroxyl radicals (HO∙). Constant advancements of technology, chemical use, and water consumption causes for pollutants, organic and inorganic waste, bacteria, pathogens, etc. to impurify the waster around the world. For this reason, AOPs have been found to be a faster and more reliable form of purifying water as hydroxyl radicals have a reaction rate of 108 to 1010 M-1s-1. Due to the characteristics and properties of AOPs, their strengths depend on the application they are being used in. Hence, in this paper, basic AOP methods have been thoroughly and visually explained along with other studies that have shown how different AOPs when treating textile wastewaters, swimming pools, and landfill leachate can prove to be beneficial. In textile wastewaters, effluents like dye and metal are mixed with other contaminates causing the water to be toxic and hazardous for humans and wildlife. It was found that when using ozone and UV AOPs, together, lowered the COD by 51.73% while also decreasing the colour, odour, and suspended solid in activated sludge. For swimming pools, humans excrete sweat, body oils, and other waste from their body and when mixed with water can cause harmful contaminants. The section also explores how swimming pools cannot be treated the same as drinking water and how UV light break bonds between organic compounds that result in bromine forming hazardous compounds like dibromochloromethane, bromodichloromethane, and bromoform. Lastly, it was found that Fenton and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) processes are the best options for treating contaminants in landfill leachate however, the molar ratio for both Fe(II) and H2O2 should be carefully measured as excess amounts will cause for less hydroxyl radicals in the water treatment. In addition, due to hydroxyl radical’s weak property of reacting with ammonia containing contaminants, sulfate radicals were used and measured to have a 100% removal rate of ammonia and a reduction of COD by 91% in acidic conditions, pH 3.0 to 4.0.
